# Notes

## JS Accordion Behaviour

Currently this picks up the 2nd child of each accordion list element, which is the copy element that is being hidden/shown.

This would cause problems if you had more than one <p> tag for copy. I would like to revisit my solution at the end of project and see if I can refactor this to work dynamically on any <p> elements within the accordion items.

## Converting JS Accordion to purely CSS

After finishing up on the styling, I want to see if I can refactor the solution for accordion item toggling to purely CSS.
