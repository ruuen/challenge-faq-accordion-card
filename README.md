## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS
- SASS
- SVG

### What I learned

I learned about the :target selectors in CSS but have not refactored my code to implement them for a JS-only solution at this point. I will revisit this shortly and adjust using the knowledge I learned while researching.

I still need to practice more CSS background image positioning for more confidence, but overall this was a fun and relatively quick challenge to complete.
